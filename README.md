Bootcamp Project I

For this task, assume that you have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: 
An investment calculator and a loan repayment calculator.

1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do. 
    How the user capitalizes their selection should not affect how the program proceeds, i.e. ‘ Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’, ‘Investment’,           'INVESTMENT’, etc., should all be recognized as valid entries. If the user doesn’t type in a valid input, show an appropriate error message.

2. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following: 
    ■  Ask the user to input:
        ● The amount of money that they plan to invest. 
        ● The interest rate (as a percentage). 
        ● The number of years they plan on investing. 
        ● Then ask the user to input if they want “ simple” or “compound” interest. Depending on whether or not they chose “simple” or “compound”, output   
           the appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period, at the specified interest rate. 

3. If the user selects "loan": 
      ■ Ask the user to input:  
         ● The amount to borrow , i.e. 100000
         ● The interest rate, i.e. 7%
         ● The number of months they plan to repay the loan, i.e. 120 months
      ■ Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month and output the result.
